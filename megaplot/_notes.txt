Notes

Bug in plotVolcstat/Multi - Y axes have wrong labels.

might be more than one mag type columns in select and collect


Work out best way to pass plot properties, line properties, axes limits etc


new functions
plotVertLine( optional label )
plotVTstrings

hold on after every plot

dates of phases etc don't have times

for hypo, calculate daily/weekly/monthly counts and mean values, return as hypo structure?

check vt with L or LV or nowt

read phase info into Hypo, then use it to check wierd stations

barwidth isn't set in plotCollectSelect

add felt events to mag plots (option)

IMPORTANT
change structure for Hypo in select and stuff
check I have done ALLLF correct ALLLP
move string count away from text file
check counts from different fetches
setStandard and setPeriod to have list options and not use file storage
dateSpanCommon to use hashes
remove setup.PlotBeg and setup.PlotEnd
